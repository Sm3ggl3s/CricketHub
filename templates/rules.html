  <h2>Rules of Cricket</h2>
  <h3>General Description</h3>
  <p>The rules of cricket are primarily considered as the "laws of cricket."</p>
  <p>Cricket is played with a bat and ball.</p>
  <p>There are two types of bowlers - fast bowlers and spin bowlers.</p>
  <p>There are two teams of 11 each in a cricket match. One team bowls with the ball and the other team bats.</p>
  <p>Bowlers can bowl overs. An over consists of 6 legal deliveries from the bowler. The limit on overs depends on the format of the game.</p>
  <p>There are two batsmen on opposite ends of the field at a time.</p>
  <p>There are two sets of 3 stumps at each end with each batsmen.</p>
  <p>Batters can get out by having the ball hit their stumps (bowled) or by having a fielder catch a ball (caught).</p>
